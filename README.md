# Tupper - Food Storage Tracker!

## Track expiry dates & combat food waste!

- Tupper‚Äôs goal is to empower you to throw away less food, save money and help the environment.
- It is estimated that up to 30-40% of the food supply in the United States is wasted and nearly 1/2 of all fruit and vegetables produced globally are wasted each year1. That, in turn, is a waste of energy, water, labor, and money resources. Especially during this global recession, you can save money simply by buying only what you need, eating what you buy, and avoiding throwing away food.

- Tupper is a mobile application that empowers you to quickly inventory and manage your food, track and be alerted to items that are going bad, and encourages you to use or donate your food items instead of just throwing them away.
