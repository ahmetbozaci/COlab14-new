    text: 'Nuts have a naturally high fat content and can spoil within a few days if exposed to heat and sunlight. Rancid nuts are destined for the garbage, which is a shame, especially since they can be a pricey item. Storing all kinds of nuts in the freezer allows for the purchase of larger packages at a discount and keeps them in good condition for up to a few months.',
